# Reinforcement Learning for Trading: Course Overview 

The goal of this course is to equip you with the knowledge and skills to design a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** model for **live financial trading**. You will also gain hands-on experience in **risk management**, **strategy optimization**, and **performance analysis**.

## What You Will Learn ðŸŽ¯

- Understand how RL solves the **delayed gratification** problem  
- Learn the core components of RL: **state**, **action**, **reward**, **policy**, **experience replay**, and **Double Q-learning**  
- Build, test, and deploy an RL model from scratch  
- Analyze **returns** and **risk** using performance metrics  
- Use a ready-made **API template** to integrate RL into live trading

## Course Structure: 3 Core Modules ðŸ“š

### 1. RL Fundamentals

- Why RL is needed and where traditional ML falls short  
- Key concepts: neural networks, Q-tables, policies, and experience replay  
- How actions are selected and rewards are optimized

### 2. Coding and Backtesting ðŸ’»

- Construct states from weakly predictive and weakly stationary features  
- Build a replay memory and train Deep Q-Networks (DQNs)  
- Combine all components to backtest your strategy  
- Evaluate performance using both synthetic and real-world market data

### 3. Live Trading and Enhancements ðŸš€

- Steps to deploy the RL model in **live markets**  
- Challenges you may face in real-time trading  
- Use the provided template to start **live trading**  
- Learn how to enhance the model with insights from research

## Additional Resources ðŸ“¦

- **Capstone project** to apply everything you've learned  
- Model solutions and Jupyter Notebooks  
- Access all files and code from a single downloadable folder
