# Deep Reinforcement Learning & Trading: Basics

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the promising fields of machine learning. This method enables an artificial intelligence (agent) to interact with its environment and gradually learn the best decisions based on a system of rewards and penalties.
Google’s DeepMind team used this method to develop an AI that defeated the world’s best players in the game of Go. Go was considered a game that artificial intelligences could not master for many years due to the vast number of possible moves. However, RL has changed this perception.

The logic of RL is similar to dog training:
- ✅ Correct action = Reward (Positive Reinforcement)
- ❌ Incorrect action = Punishment (Negative Reinforcement)

Reinforcement learning applies this learning structure in various environments, producing successful results in many areas, from games and robotic systems to algorithmic trading.

# Reinforcement Learning & Maze Analogy

Reinforcement learning enables an artificial intelligence (AI) to learn the best action through a reward-punishment system. This process can be compared to solving a maze.

In the maze:
- 🕳️ Pits and 💀 monsters → represent punishment (negative outcome),
- 🌀 Springboards → represent reward (positive outcome).

The goal is not just to find the exit, but to learn the **shortest**, **safest**, and **most rewarding** path. The AI develops the **most efficient strategy** over time by trying different paths. In this process, there is no single “correct direction”; **the goal is to optimize the total reward.**

# Reinforcement Learning and Patient Investment Decisions

In 2018, Tesla stock was around $300, and by early 2020, it had reached $650. This means doubling the investment. Looking back, this decision might seem easy, but staying patient during the investment process is difficult. In 2019, Tesla’s stock remained below $320. Many investors exited during this period because the stock didn’t seem promising. However, in just two months, the price exceeded $600. The lesson here: **those who were patient won**. This is known as **delayed gratification**.

So, how long should one wait? When is the right time to exit? These questions are hard to answer clearly. This is where **reinforcement learning** comes into play.

Reinforcement learning uses short-term rewards to aim for the highest long-term gain. The reward system is designed based on criteria like profit, time, and trading volume. The model tests different scenarios based on historical data and learns the best strategy. For example, it might discover that exiting in January 2020 was the optimal move.

This approach allows artificial intelligence to optimize real-time investment decisions.

# 📊 Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Real Stock Market Data

**❓ Will this course apply an RL model to real trading, or is it just theory?**  
✅ **Answer:** Yes — an RL model will be used for **real-time buy/sell decisions**.

We will build a **Core Engine** using Python — this is the heart of the RL model.

### 🔗 Step 1: Backtesting
-  The model is tested on **10–20 years of historical market data**.
-  The goal is to see how the model would have performed in the past.
-  If it performs well, we **use it directly** — **no retraining needed**.

### 🔗 Step 2: Connect to Real-Time Data
-  The model is connected to **live market data**.
-  It generates **buy/sell signals** via a **broker API**.

### 🔗 Step 3: Paper Trading
-  **No real money is used**.
-  The model makes trades in a **simulated environment** to test real-time decisions safely.
   
### 🔗 Step 4: Live Trading
- If everything works well, we move to **real trading with real money**.
- The RL model now makes actual investment decisions in real time.


📌 **Key Point:**  
Reinforcement learning focuses on **long-term rewards**, not just quick wins.  
It learns when to wait and when to act — just like a smart investor.

- If the paper trading phase is successful, we will move on to **live trading** with real capital.

## 🛠️ What Will We Focus on in This Course?

**90% of the course will focus on writing and improving the Core Engine** — the actual **Reinforcement Learning (RL) model** that makes trading decisions.

At the end of the course, you'll receive a **ready-to-use template**  
for:
-  Fetching real market data  
-  Sending buy/sell signals via a broker API

But the **most important part** is this:

💡 **Making the Core Engine smarter**
-  Optimizing strategy parameters  
-  Building a system that can make intelligent, data-driven decisions

This is where true performance comes from:  
Not just trading, but **learning how to trade better over time**.
